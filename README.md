## overview :

Cafe experiences have evolved beyond just coffee; they've become a canvas for capturing moments. Our cafe offers a unique blend of flavors and aesthetics, inviting customers to book appointments for personalized photo shoots. Embracing the digital age, we've made booking seamless through our website. Much like the evolution of sunglasses shopping, where brands like Ray-Ban and Oakley offer convenience, we strive to provide a delightful experience, blending coffee culture with photography, all at your fingertips. 

Our cafe website re imagines the concept of a coffee break, with the following objectives driving us:
Streamline the booking process, providing an experience akin to visiting our cafe in person. Introduce a per-booking option, enabling customers to secure their spot for a memorable photo session. Curate a diverse menu of coffee blends and styles to cater to various tastes and preferences. Offer personalized photo session packages, ensuring a unique and memorable experience for each customer.

## Service used :

Azure Virtual Machine :

Azure virtual machines are one of several types of on demand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers. Typically, you choose a virtual machine when you need more control over the computing environment than the other choices offer. This article gives you information about what you should consider before you create a virtual machine, how you create it, and how you manage it.

Load Balancer in Azure:

Azure Load Balancer is a Layer 4 (TCP, UDP) load balancer that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple virtual machines to ensure high availability and reliability of applications. It offers scalable and highly available load balancing services for Azure virtual machines and cloud services, allowing you to build resilient and performant applications.

Domain Name System (DNS):

Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the industry-standard suites of protocols that comprise TCP/IP, and together the DNS Client and DNS Server provide computer name-to-IP address mapping name resolution services to computers and users.

Azure Language Studio:

Azure Language Studio is a comprehensive suite of AI powered language services offered by Microsoft Azure. It enables developers to build natural language processing (NLP) capabilities into their applications, allowing them to understand and generate human-like text in multiple languages. Language Studio provides a wide range of tools and APIs that facilitate tasks such as text analysis, translation, sentiment analysis, and language understanding.
