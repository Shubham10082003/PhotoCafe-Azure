### overview :

Our project aims to transform the online sunglasses shopping experience by integrating cutting-edge technology and innovative features. Leveraging Azure services like virtual machines, load balancers, DNS zones, and Azure Language Service for a chatbot, we automate the purchasing process and introduce a unique home trial service. This service allows users to schedule appointments to try on sunglasses in the comfort of their homes before making a purchase, bridging the gap between online and in-store experiences.
In addition to these features, our platform curates a diverse collection of sunglasses for children, catering to a previously underserved market segment. We also offer customized options, allowing users to personalize their sunglasses based on their preferences and styles.
Sunglasses are not just accessories; they are symbols of style and personality that transcend cultural and generational boundaries. With the evolution of technology and the rise of e-commerce, access to fashionable eyewear has become more convenient than ever. However, the sheer number of options available online can be overwhelming. Our platform addresses this challenge by providing a curated selection of sunglasses from renowned brands to niche designers like Ray-Ban, Oakley, and Warby Parker, making it easier for consumers to find the perfect pair from the comfort of their homes, anytime, anywhere.
Our primary objective is to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience that mirrors the convenience and satisfaction of traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Through our innovative approach and commitment to customer satisfaction, we aim to set a new standard for online sunglasses shopping.

### Service used :

Azure Virtual Machine :

Azure virtual machines are one of several types of ondemand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers. 
Typically, you choose a virtual machine when you need more 
control over the computing environment than the other 
choices offer. This article gives you information about what 
you should consider before you create a virtual machine, 
how you create it, and how you manage it.

Load Balancer in Azure:

Azure Load Balancer is a Layer 4 (TCP, UDP) load balancer 
that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple 
virtual machines to ensure high availability and reliability of 
applications. It offers scalable and highly available load 
balancing services for Azure virtual machines and cloud 
services, allowing you to build resilient and performant 
applications.

Domain Name System (DNS): 

Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the industry-standard 
suites of protocols that comprise TCP/IP, and together the 
DNS Client and DNS Server provide computer name-to-IP 
address mapping name resolution services to computers and 
users. 

Azure Language Studio:

Azure Language Studio is a comprehensive suite of AIpowered language services offered by Microsoft Azure. It 
enables developers to build natural language processing 
(NLP) capabilities into their applications, allowing them to 
understand and generate human-like text in multiple 
languages. Language Studio provides a wide range of tools 
and APIs that facilitate tasks such as text analysis, 
translation, sentiment analysis, and language understanding.
